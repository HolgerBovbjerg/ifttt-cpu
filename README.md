# ifttt-cpu
This repository contains material made for a 4th semester project on Aalborg University.

## Included material
The material includes vhdl files for a softcore CPU implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA as well as a simple assembler for creating programs to run on the CPU. 

## Main focus
The main focus of the project is to implement a softcore CPU on an FPGA that resembles a hardware pendant to the IFTTT web service, i.e. it can be used to trigger certion actions depending on inputs.
